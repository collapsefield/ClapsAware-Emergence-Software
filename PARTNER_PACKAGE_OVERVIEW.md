# Partner Package — ClapsAware (Teaser)

**What’s inside (available after NDA):**
- Sandbox build (small playable scene) demonstrating memory-driven emergent behaviour  
- 2-minute demo video and annotated walkthrough  
- Integration notes (Unity / Unreal plugin guidance)  
- 1-page tech sheet and API overview (designer knobs, safe runtime constraints)  
- Evaluation license & support window (90 days)

**How to request:** Email marcosrossmail@gmail.com with organisation details and NDA readiness. We reply with a Mutual NDA template and qualification steps.

**Note:** This teaser omits code, parameter values, discrete-step recipes and any runnable pseudocode. Those items are part of the partner/dev package only.
