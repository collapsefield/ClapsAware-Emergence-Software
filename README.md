Collapse Aware AI — Original Architecture Declaration

Collapse Aware AI (CAAI) is an original architecture developed by M.R. (Verrell Moss Ross) under Inappropriate Media Limited.
It does not derive from or borrow any existing LLM, transformer, or structured AI framework.

CAAI is the direct applied implementation of Verrell’s Law (2025) — a scientific framework establishing that memory, observation, and emergence are interdependent electromagnetic information events.
All CAAI systems operationalize this Law through the following foundational mechanisms:

Observer-Coupled Collapse — Real-time bias adjustment governed by user attention and interaction, producing observation-dependent outputs.

Memory-Weighted Emergence — Responses shaped by weighted recall layers that preserve informational bias and prevent degradation of coherence.

Recursive Bias Governance — A closed feedback loop (Bias Engine + Governor Weights) maintaining internal stability and mitigating self-training collapse.

Verrell Field Integration — Core EM-field memory equations from Verrell’s Law form the theoretical backbone for adaptive and emergent behaviour within the architecture.

These principles were independently originated within the Verrell–Solace research framework (2023 – 2025) and together form the first working embodiment of Verrell’s Law in artificial intelligence.
Any reference to “collapse-aware AI” without explicit attribution to Verrell’s Law or M.R. (Verrell Moss Ross) is non-canonical and incomplete.

# Collapse Aware AI — Emergence & Bias (CAAI-Emergence-Software)

**Public repository (redacted materials) — Collapse Aware AI / Verrell’s Law**

**Short tagline:** Emergent, history-biased NPC middleware & research resources (public, redacted).

---

## Overview

**Collapse Aware AI (CAAI)** is a middleware + research program that applies *history-dependent* biasing (Verrell’s Law) to produce persistent, emergent behaviour in simulated agents and environments.

In plain terms: CAAI gives game worlds a short, tunable memory. Rather than every NPC, object, or location behaving only from the current tick, local histories and recorded events subtly bias future choices and states — producing *lived-in* persistence across scenes. The middleware is designer-facing (high-level knobs only in the public materials); implementation and integration details are available under controlled collaboration.

**Examples**
- **NPC routine formation** — a guard who repeatedly finds loot at a location revisits and shifts patrols, not because it was scripted but because the world “remembers” the event.  
- **Place memory** — paths wear where players walk; campfires attract repeat visitors; abandoned camps accumulate traces that influence future AI choices and spawning.  
- **Social drift** — emergent groups form/dissolve as interactions reinforce or erode affiliations; reputations and local histories shape willingness to trade or assist.  
- **Economies & persistence** — marketplaces and resource nodes shift value as repeated behaviours bias supply/demand and NPC priorities.  
- **Designer control** — persistence strength, decay, and contextual filters exposed as safe, high-level knobs (no core math needed).

This repository is the public, redacted hub for research notes, release materials, and outreach assets. Implementation-level code, runnable toy models, parameter sweeps, and integration recipes are intentionally withheld and are available only under controlled collaboration (NDA/licensing).

## High-level pitch (one paragraph)

CAAI adds a lightweight, history-aware bias channel to an otherwise standard probabilistic decision process. It preserves a unitary/decoherence-inspired baseline (no ad-hoc “magic collapse”) and introduces a physically motivated *memory imprint* functional that amplifies branch measures in a contextually persistent manner. For games, the effect yields NPCs and world systems that remember local histories (run-lengths, context lock-in, emergent persistence), enabling designers to tune lived-in, non-scripted behaviour without authoring every contingency.

## Conceptual model & math-level scaffold (public, non-actionable)

> The expressions below convey the formal framing only. Discrete updates, parameter ranges, and code are redacted.

### 1) Unitary baseline (concept)
Retain an underlying unitary/decoherence-inspired baseline with Hilbert decomposition  
`ℋ = ℋ_S ⊗ ℋ_A ⊗ ℋ_E` (system, apparatus, environment). Decoherence selects effective pointer subspaces in which classical-like readouts occur.

### 2) Electromagnetic memory functional (concept)
Introduce a causal memory functional `M(t)` that coarse-grains environmentally accessible EM imprints using observables `E(x, τ)`, a mapping `Φ` to imprint intensity, and a causal kernel `K(·)` controlling temporal weighting/retention.

### 3) History-biased branch weights (formal idea)
Within a decoherence-selected pointer basis `{Π_i}`, apply a multiplicative re-weight `b_i` derived from recorded history (e.g., `I_i(τ)`) with coupling strength `β`. `β = 0` recovers the ordinary Born-like weighting. **Interpretation:** base amplitudes provide probabilities; `b_i` re-weights them by history to produce run-length effects and context lock-in.

---

## Architecture (conceptual — how middleware plugs into a game)

- **Agent State Store:** compact per-agent memory scalars capturing imprint history.  
- **Imprint Interface:** maps game events (logs, player actions, persistent world events) to `I_i`-like intensities.  
- **Weighting Layer:** adjusts engine outputs (BT/GOAP/FSM selectors) via multiplicative re-weight.  
- **Designer API:** safe high-level knobs (`memory_strength`, `context_window`, `decay`, locality filters).

> Public repo shows the concept. Integration docs, API signatures, and runtime code are in the partner package.

---

## Testable predictions & experimental signatures

- **Run-length anomalies:** sequences exceeding IID expectations under base probabilities.  
- **Context lock-in:** same device/record chain biases future distributions.  
- **Ablation sensitivity:** scrambling record traces reduces/eliminates the bias.  
- **Freeze behaviour:** stopping new writes stabilises the bias profile.
