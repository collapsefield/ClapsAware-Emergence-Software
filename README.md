# ClapsAware — Emergence & Bias (ClapsAware-Emergence-Software)

**Public repository (redacted materials) — CollapseAware AI / Verrell’s Law**

**Short tagline:** Emergent, history-biased NPC middleware & research resources (public, redacted).

---

## Overview

**ClapsAware** (CollapseAware AI) is a middleware + research program that explores *history-dependent* biasing of branch measures (Verrell’s Law) to produce persistent, emergent behaviour in simulated agents and games.

This repository is the public, redacted hub for our research notes, release materials, and outreach assets. We intentionally withhold implementation-level code, runnable toy models, parameter sweeps, and integration recipes from the public drop. Those items are available only under a controlled collaboration (NDA/licensing).

## High-level pitch (one paragraph)

ClapsAware adds a lightweight, history-aware bias channel to an otherwise standard probabilistic decision process. It preserves the unitary/decoherence-inspired framework (no ad-hoc collapse) and introduces a physically motivated *memory imprint* functional that amplifies branch measures in a contextually persistent manner. For games, the effect produces NPCs and world systems that remember local histories (run-lengths, context lock-in, emergent persistence), enabling designers to tune lived-in, non-scripted behavior without authoring every contingency.

## Conceptual model & math-level scaffold (public, non-actionable)

> The equations below are intended to convey the formal, conceptual framing. Implementation details (discrete updates, parameter ranges, code) are intentionally redacted from the public materials.

### 1) Unitary baseline (concept)
We retain an underlying unitary/decoherence-inspired baseline for the generative process:


with Hilbert decomposition `ℋ = ℋ_S ⊗ ℋ_A ⊗ ℋ_E` (system, apparatus, environment). Decoherence selects effective pointer subspaces in which classical-like readouts occur.

### 2) Electromagnetic memory functional (concept)
We introduce a causal memory functional `M(t)` that coarse-grains environmentally accessible EM imprints:


- `E(x, τ)` — coarse EM observables (device currents, persistent magnetisation proxies, time-stamped record events).  
- `Φ` — mapping from field configurations → scalar imprint intensity.  
- `K(·)` — a causal kernel controlling temporal weighting / resonance (decay, retention, or oscillatory structure).

### 3) Biased branch weights (formal expression)
Within a decoherence-selected pointer basis `{Π_i}`, we express a history-weighted branch measure:


with


- `I_i(τ)` — imprint intensity associated with outcome class `i`.  
- `β` — memory coupling strength (conceptual).  
- `β = 0` recovers the ordinary Born-like weighting.

**Interpretation:** The standard decoherence/Born amplitude supplies base probabilities; `b_i` multiplicatively re-weights them according to recorded history, producing run-length effects and context lock-in.

> IMPORTANT: The public copy does not include discrete update rules, per-step pseudocode, parameter values, or a runnable toy model. Those items are part of the partner/dev package.

## Architecture (conceptual — how middleware plugs into a game)

We provide a high-level, non-actionable view of the middleware architecture:


- **Agent State Store:** small persistent per-agent memory scalars capturing imprint history (non-sensitive, compressed).  
- **Imprint Interface:** receives coarse contextual signals from game events (e.g., writes to logs, player actions, persistent world events) and maps them to `I_i`-like intensities.  
- **Weighting Layer:** adjusts decision probabilities produced by the engine (behavior trees, selectors) using a multiplicative re-weight.  
- **Designer API:** exposes safe, high-level knobs (e.g., `memory_strength`, `context_window`, `decay`) which designers can tune without needing to inspect internal math.  

> Public repo shows the concept. Integration docs, API signatures, and runtime code live in the partner package.

## Testable predictions & experimental signatures (public)

ClapsAware makes empirically falsifiable claims at a statistical level. High-level tests include:

- **Run-length anomalies:** sequences of repeated outcomes that exceed IID expectations under base probabilities.  
- **Context lock-in:** local contexts (same device, same recording chain) influence future outcome distributions.  
- **Ablation sensitivity:** physically scrambling record traces reduces/eliminates the bias.  
- **Freeze behaviour:** stopping new writes stabilises bias.

Laboratory or in-game A/B tests can attempt to reveal these effects. Public note describes concepts; experimental protocols and data pipelines are part of controlled collaboration.

## Roadmap & releases

**v1-public-redacted** — initial publication: math scaffold, conceptual notes, public redacted PDF.  
**v1.1-research** — future public notes: conceptual expansions, non-actionable theoretical extensions.  
**partner-v1** — private partner package (NDA): demo builds, integration notes, SDK, parameter sweeps (not public).

We will use GitHub Releases to track public drops. Partner packages will be distributed under a controlled channel once an NDA is in place.

## How to request the partner package (NDA / licensing)

1. Email `marcosrossmail@gmail.com` with subject: `CollapseAware — Collaboration Request`.  
2. Include: organisation, role, desired scope (evaluation/demo/integration), contact details, and NDA readiness.  
3. We respond with a Mutual NDA template and a short qualification questionnaire. After NDA, we provide the partner package (sandbox build, tech sheet, integration notes).

## Licensing & IP

All public materials are licensed **proprietary**. Implementation assets and demos are the intellectual property of the author (VMR-Core). For evaluation, licensing, or enterprise options contact the author. Public materials may be used for discussion, citation, and inquiry only; do not attempt to reconstruct the partner package from this redacted summary.

## Contributing (public repo policy)

This public repository accepts limited, non-actionable issues and discussions (research questions, requests for clarification). We will not accept or review pull requests that attempt to add runnable algorithms, code, or discrete toy models to the public tree — those contributions will be redirected to the partner package process.

If you are an academic or institution interested in collaboration, open an issue with your institutional email and we’ll provide NDA instructions.

## FAQ (short)

**Q:** Is the public PDF runnable?  
**A:** No — it is intentionally redacted. Implementation assets are only provided under NDA or licensing.

**Q:** Can I cite the public note?  
**A:** Yes — cite **M.R. (Verrell Moss Ross)** and link to this repository.

**Q:** How do I get a demo?  
**A:** Email `marcosrossmail@gmail.com` with "Collaboration Request"; we will send NDA and qualification steps.

## Final note from the author (short)

ClapsAware is research-first: we publish conceptual framing publicly and protect engineering value for partners. If you are serious about testing, licensing, or integration we’ll move quickly once an NDA is in place. — **M.R. (VMR-Core)**
