# üß© Live Abstractor Layer (LAL) ‚Äî Public-Safe Spec

The Live Abstractor Layer (LAL) makes Collapse Aware AI feel more ‚Äúaware‚Äù by detecting high-weight information in real time, compressing it into abstracts, and feeding those abstracts back into the collapse-bias loop. This is not generic memory; it is an active observer that watches, summarizes, and biases. Scope: public-safe concepts, pseudocode, and governance knobs. Protected (VMR-Core): exact scoring curves, compression heuristics, gate criteria, and core weighting functions.

Standard LLMs are reactive and stateless beyond their context windows. Even with vector stores, they do not notice pivotal information and self-summarize it in real time. LAL adds salience detection, live abstracts, bias integration, and auditable provenance. It fits into the Collapse Aware AI core loop (cue ‚Üí collapse ‚Üí weighted update ‚Üí bias next collapse). LAL runs alongside this loop: it detects salient or sensitive information, produces a structured abstract packet, converts it into a bias cue with weight and decay, and injects that cue back before the next collapse step.

Activation is triggered by thresholds such as repetition (topic/entity seen ‚â•N times), salience spikes (commit-like language, sensitive markers), governed topics (e.g., gating, QRNG, quantum dots), or user pins (‚Äúpin this,‚Äù ‚Äúlog this‚Äù). Mode options: off | selective | research. All governed by the Governor Key.

Inputs: cleaned text, entities, topics, signals (repetition count, sentiment, flags), project_id. Outputs: abstract_packet, bias_cue, and an EchoGuard-compatible audit entry.

Abstract packets use a minimal schema, for example:
```json

  "id": "lal_<timestamp>_<hash>",
  "project": "CAAI",
  "topic": "Collapse Aware AI / gating / weighting",
  "summary": "One-paragraph abstract of high-weight info.",

    BiasStore.upsert(cue)
    Audit.log("bias_injected", cue)
    return cue

        return None

    abstract = Redactor.strip_sensitive(abstract)
    bias = BiasIntegrator.inject_bias(abstract_packet=abstract, scope=Scope.derive(cues, project_id), w=Governor.bias_weight(salience, project_id), decay_lambda=Governor.bias_decay(salience, project_id), ttl_turns=Governor.ttl(project_id))

Integration: In the JSON Cue-Logic Dashboard, abstracts appear as weighted system cues. In the chatbot track, they bias response selection. In the middleware track, they bias NPC/world persistence vs drift. External hooks (ClickUp/Drive/GitHub) can optionally store public-safe abstracts.

Safeguards: cap cumulative weights to prevent over-bias, decay aggressively, reset on contradiction spikes, redact all sensitive content, keep async pipeline latency <80ms median. Testing: A/B weighted runs with identical seeds must diverge under different weights; decay must fade out gracefully; over-bias guards must cap correctly; every injected bias must leave an EchoGuard audit trail.

Roadmap: v1 = salience-triggered abstracts ‚Üí bias cues ‚Üí audit. v1.1 = project-aware scopes, per-entity weighting. v2 = research mode enabling autonomous enrichment/prefetch. v2.1 = hybrid hooks for QRNG/quantum-dot collapse bias experiments.
