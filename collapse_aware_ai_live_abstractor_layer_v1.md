# üß© Live Abstractor Layer (LAL) ‚Äî Module Spec (Public-Safe)

**Purpose:**  
Make the system feel *aware* by detecting **high-weight information** in real time, compressing it into **actionable abstracts**, and feeding those abstracts back into the **collapse-bias** loop. This is not generic ‚Äúlong-term memory‚Äù; it‚Äôs an **active observer** that watches, summarizes, and biases.

> Public-safe overview. Core heuristics, scoring curves, and governor policies remain VMR-Core protected.

---

## 1) Problem Statement

Standard LLMs are reactive and stateless beyond context windows. Even with vector memory, they don‚Äôt **notice** when something is pivotal and **self-summarize** it on the fly.  
**LAL** adds:
- **Salience detection** (what carries weight),
- **Live abstracts** (compressed context packets),
- **Bias integration** (abstracts nudge the next collapse).

---

## 2) High-Level Flow

‚îî‚îÄ‚ñ∂ WeightAssessor # importance scoring
‚îî‚îÄ‚ñ∂ LiveAbstractor # generate abstract (structured)
‚îî‚îÄ‚ñ∂ BiasIntegrator # inject as weighted cue
‚îî‚îÄ‚ñ∂ Collapse loop (cue ‚Üí collapse ‚Üí weighted update)

yaml
Copy code

---

## 3) Triggers (when LAL activates)

- **Repetition threshold:** topic/entity seen N times in M turns.
- **Salience spike:** strong language / certainty / tagged ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù.
- **Governed topics:** pre-registered (e.g., Collapse Aware AI, gating, papers).
- **User pins:** ‚Äúpin this‚Äù, ‚Äúlog this‚Äù, ‚Äúabstract this‚Äù.

> All triggers are tunable via Governor Key (public-safe knobs below).

---

## 4) Inputs / Outputs

**Inputs:**
- `turn_text` (cleaned)
- `entities[]` (NER pass)
- `topics[]` (classifier)
- `signals` (recurrence count, sentiment, uncertainty, PII flags)

**Outputs:**
- `abstract_packet` (see ¬ß5)
- `bias_cue` (normalized weight + TTL)
- `audit_log` entry (for EchoGuard provenance)

## 5) Abstract Packet Schema (public-safe)

Note: internal scoring curves, compression ratios, and redaction rules are VMR-Core.

6) Bias Integrator (public-safe interface)
Converts abstract_packet ‚Üí bias_cue with weight w ‚àà [0,1], decay Œª, scope S (topics/entities).

Injects cue before next collapse step.

11) Integration Points
JSON Cue-Logic Dashboard: abstracts appear as system cues with weights.

Chatbot Track: abstracts influence response selection & tool choice.

Middleware (CAAI): abstracts can bias agent/world update rules (e.g., tuning persistence/drift).

ClickUp/Drive/GitHub (optional): write-through hooks (public-safe summaries only).

12) Failure Modes & Safeguards
Over-biasing: cap cumulative weight per topic; decay aggressively.

So let's just give it to me all in just one GitHub, so just one filename, and just one big, long, detailed, um, one lot of copy and paste code I can do, because I can't be arsed to make all these separate files and stuff. I'm still learning GitHub, by the way. I've come a long way, I didn't know a thing about it when I started five, six months ago. So, um, yeah, give me, um, just the filename and all the code in one section of code, body of text, whatever you want to call it.

## 0) Quick Context (where LAL fits)

- **Collapse Aware AI (CAAI)** core loop: `cue ‚Üí collapse ‚Üí weighted_update ‚Üí bias_next_collapse`.
- **LAL** runs alongside the loop:
  - Detects **salient / sensitive / high-weight** info during a turn.
  - Produces a **structured abstract_packet**.
  - Converts it into a **bias_cue** with weight & decay.
  - Injects that cue back *before the next collapse step*.

---

## 1) Problem Statement

Standard LLMs are reactive and (aside from buffer/context) stateless. Even with vector stores, they rarely **notice** pivotal info and **self-summarize** it on the fly.  
**LAL** adds:
- **Salience detection** (what carries weight),

# üß© Live Abstractor Layer (LAL) ‚Äî Public-Safe Spec

The Live Abstractor Layer (LAL) makes Collapse Aware AI feel more ‚Äúaware‚Äù by detecting high-weight information in real time, compressing it into abstracts, and feeding those abstracts back into the collapse-bias loop. This is not generic memory; it is an active observer that watches, summarizes, and biases. Scope: public-safe concepts, pseudocode, and governance knobs. Protected (VMR-Core): exact scoring curves, compression heuristics, gate criteria, and core weighting functions.

Standard LLMs are reactive and stateless beyond their context windows. Even with vector stores, they do not notice pivotal information and self-summarize it in real time. LAL adds salience detection, live abstracts, bias integration, and auditable provenance. It fits into the Collapse Aware AI core loop (cue ‚Üí collapse ‚Üí weighted update ‚Üí bias next collapse). LAL runs alongside this loop: it detects salient or sensitive information, produces a structured abstract packet, converts it into a bias cue with weight and decay, and injects that cue back before the next collapse step.

Activation is triggered by thresholds such as repetition (topic/entity seen ‚â•N times), salience spikes (commit-like language, sensitive markers), governed topics (e.g., gating, QRNG, quantum dots), or user pins (‚Äúpin this,‚Äù ‚Äúlog this‚Äù). Mode options: off | selective | research. All governed by the Governor Key.

Inputs: cleaned text, entities, topics, signals (repetition count, sentiment, flags), project_id. Outputs: abstract_packet, bias_cue, and an EchoGuard-compatible audit entry.

Abstract packets use a minimal schema, for example:
```json
{
  "id": "lal_<timestamp>_<hash>",
  "project": "CAAI",
  "topic": "Collapse Aware AI / gating / weighting",
  "summary": "One-paragraph abstract of high-weight info.",
  "bullets": ["Key point 1", "Key point 2", "Decision/assumption"],
  "citations": ["internal:turn_...", "repo:path/file.md#anchor"],
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "ttl_turns": 20,
  "tags": ["sensitive","design","roadmap"],
  "created_at": "ISO-8601",
  "fingerprint": "VMR-public-hash"
}
The Bias Integrator converts abstract_packet ‚Üí bias_cue with weight w‚àà[0,1], decay Œª, ttl, and scope. Example interface:

python
Copy code
def inject_bias(abstract_packet, scope, w: float, decay_lambda: float, ttl_turns: int) -> BiasCue:
    cue = BiasCue(topic=abstract_packet["topic"], weight=w, decay=decay_lambda, ttl=ttl_turns, ref=abstract_packet["id"], project=abstract_packet.get("project","CAAI"))
    BiasStore.upsert(cue)
    Audit.log("bias_injected", cue)
    return cue
Minimal pseudocode:

python
Copy code
def process_turn(turn_text, project_id="CAAI"):
    cues = CueDetector.extract(turn_text)
    salience = WeightAssessor.score(cues, turn_text)
    if not Governor.allow_lal(salience, project_id):
        return None
    abstract = LiveAbstractor.build(cues, turn_text, project_id)
    abstract = Redactor.strip_sensitive(abstract)
    bias = BiasIntegrator.inject_bias(abstract_packet=abstract, scope=Scope.derive(cues, project_id), w=Governor.bias_weight(salience, project_id), decay_lambda=Governor.bias_decay(salience, project_id), ttl_turns=Governor.ttl(project_id))
    EchoGuard.record("lal_abstract", abstract)
    return {"abstract": abstract, "bias": bias}
Storage and redaction: BiasStore is ephemeral and encrypted, AbstractStore redacts PII and code, EchoGuard records append-only audit entries. Telemetry: lal_triggered count, avg_salience, avg_bias_weight, abstract length, ttl averages, downstream_effect metrics (protected details withheld).

Integration: In the JSON Cue-Logic Dashboard, abstracts appear as weighted system cues. In the chatbot track, they bias response selection. In the middleware track, they bias NPC/world persistence vs drift. External hooks (ClickUp/Drive/GitHub) can optionally store public-safe abstracts.

Safeguards: cap cumulative weights to prevent over-bias, decay aggressively, reset on contradiction spikes, redact all sensitive content, keep async pipeline latency <80ms median. Testing: A/B weighted runs with identical seeds must diverge under different weights; decay must fade out gracefully; over-bias guards must cap correctly; every injected bias must leave an EchoGuard audit trail.

Roadmap: v1 = salience-triggered abstracts ‚Üí bias cues ‚Üí audit. v1.1 = project-aware scopes, per-entity weighting. v2 = research mode enabling autonomous enrichment/prefetch. v2.1 = hybrid hooks for QRNG/quantum-dot collapse bias experiments.
